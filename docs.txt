Post Instructions
* Assign categories for filtering
* Text category will display background image and text from post always.  It's best to wrap this text with a <p> tag or add some markup if need be.
* About Artisan is a special category for the About Artisan section, it's best to not to assign anything else that category
	It handles the frame background and other special reposive sizing because this is a unique text based grid item
* Masonry height and width are integers
	Height max is 3
	Width max is 5
* If no height or width is assigned, 1 is set
* If integers higher than the max is set, the max is used
* Display priority helps determine where the item might show up
	It's an integer between 0 and 100
	Higher numbers are show higher
	The order is not guaranteed, it's just tries to follow the order... several factors are in play here
